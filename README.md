# ConanBot
Discord twitter bot for Conan O'Brien

# What does it do?
When you invite this bot to a discord channel, you can type in commands in any chat channel and this bot can respond to those commands.
It is currently a twitter bot, where it will respond random tweets from Conan O'Briens twitter, who is my favourite comedian/late-night host

# What is Discord?
Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for video gaming communities, that specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel.

# What did I learn from making this application?
I have enchanced my skills in Object-Orientated programming by using C++, which is a language I do not often use but was the easiest
language to use to create this bot. I have also learned a lot about modularity in software development, splitting up my code makes it
easier to maintain and make changes. If I wanted to, I can expand this bot and make it respond to more useful commands because
of how I structured the code. Modularity really did save a lot of time on my end and has given me insights on the importance of
modularity.

Making this application, I can now say that I have experienced using other libraries and APIs that are not native to C++/any other language.
I had to use the Discord and Twitter libraries to make this application work and has given me confidence in developing applications for other applications.

# Bot Commands:

conan tweet -> Recieve a tweet from Conan's twitter
conan update -> Get the latest tweet from Conan
conan joke -> ConanBot would join the same voice channel you are in and start playing a 5 min clip of Conan visiting Bethlehem, my favourite clip of him experience the Middle East
